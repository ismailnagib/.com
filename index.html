      Hello, my name is Muhammad Ismail Yusuf.
    </p>
    <p id="profile-subtitle">
      I'm a software developer.
    </p>
    <p id="profile-content">
      I graduated from high school in mid-2018, then soon after that,
      took my gamble on a coding boot camp called <a href="https://hacktiv8.com/fullstack" target="_blank" class="profile-link">Hacktiv8</a>.<br><br>
      
      
      I presented my final project towards the end of November and have started working
      at my current company, Axiata Digital Services Indonesia, since the beginning of
      January 2019.<br><br>

      Besides programming, I love watching movies and traveling. I haven't traveled much but
      I do hope that one day I can travel around the world.<br><br>
      
      If you want to know me and join me on my adventures, you can start by following me on
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ismailnagib" target="_blank" class="profile-link">Instagram</a>.
      I don't post anything on my feed though, you should wait for my stories.<br><br>

      Now, did you happen to notice that the domain that I'm using is actually ismailnagib.com, not
      let's say, ismailyusuf.com or something like that?<br><br>
      
      Well, the "nagib" part is actually
      my family name and I'm kinda used to use it for my usernames, including my
      <a href="https://github.com/ismailnagib" target="_blank" class="profile-link">GitHub</a>
      and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismailnagib" target="_blank" class="profile-link">LinkedIn</a>
      (you are welcome to check them out, of course).
